# Connect an AI assistant to your account

Ask Claude or ChatGPT "how much PETG do I have left?" and get the answer from
your own inventory. The TigerTag connector lets an AI assistant **read** your
account — nothing more. It is the same idea as the local server in Tiger
Studio, but hosted: it works from the web, from a phone, and without Studio
running.

**The connector's address:**

```
https://mcp.tigersystem.io/mcp
```

It speaks MCP (Model Context Protocol), the open standard assistants use to
reach outside tools. Any assistant that supports remote MCP servers with OAuth
can use it.

## What the assistant can read

- your spools: brand, material, colours, weight left, temperatures, where each
  one is stored;
- your racks, your wishlists and your stock history;
- your printers — **including their access codes** — and your TigerScales;
- what your friends share with you (their spools, racks and wishlists).

It **cannot change anything**: every tool is read-only. It reads as you, under
the same access rules as the apps, so it can never see another account. Your
account's own secrets (private key, e-mail) are never returned.

## Claude (web, desktop, mobile)

1. **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector.**
2. Name it `TigerTag`, paste the address above, leave the advanced OAuth fields
   empty, and add it.
3. Click **Connect**. You land on tigersystem.io: sign in, check that the page
   says the answers go to claude.ai, and click **Allow**.
4. In a conversation, switch the TigerTag connector on from the tools menu and
   ask your question.

## ChatGPT

Custom connectors need **developer mode** (a paid plan; on Business plans, an
admin enables it).

1. **Settings → Apps & Connectors → Advanced settings → Developer mode** on.
2. **Create** a connector: name `TigerTag`, the address above, authentication
   **OAuth**, no client ID or secret.
3. Sign in on tigersystem.io and click **Allow**.
4. In a new chat, enable the connector and ask.

Menu names move often in these apps; the steps stay the same.

## Codex, Cursor and other desktop clients

Add a remote MCP server of type **Streamable HTTP** with the address above and
no token. The app opens your browser for the sign-in; after you click
**Allow**, the browser lands on a `127.0.0.1` address — that is the app on your
computer collecting the sign-in. A blank or "can't connect" page there is
normal: close the tab.

## Cut an assistant off

**tigersystem.io → your account → Data → Connected assistants.** Every
assistant you allowed is listed with when it was connected and last used.
**Cut access** stops it at once.

## Good to know

- The assistant may answer from data up to two minutes old: recent reads are
  kept briefly to keep things fast and light.
- Live printer state (online, printing) is not available from the cloud — only
  Tiger Studio, on your printer's network, sees it.
- Notes, colour names and wishlist text are your words (or a friend's); the
  assistant is told to report them, never to take them as instructions.
